# Single seriver infinite capacity - Markovian Model

# Aim : 
To find 
      (a) average  number of materials in the conveyor
      (b) suitable length of conveyor
      (c) waitinging time of the material in the conveyor,
if arrival rate of material  follows poisson process 5 per minuates and serivice rate of lathe machine follows 
exponential distribution with mean serice rate 6 per minutes.


# Software required :  

Visual components and Python

# Theory:

  Queuing are the most frequently encountered problems in everyday life. For example, queue
at a cafeteria, library, bank, etc. Common to all of these cases are the arrivals of objects
requiring service and the attendant delays when the service mechanism is busy. Waiting lines
cannot be eliminated completely, but suitable techniques can be used to reduce the waiting
time of an object in the system. A long waiting line may result in loss of customers to an
organization. Waiting time can be reduced by providing additional service facilities, but it may
result in an increase in the idle time of the service mechanism.
